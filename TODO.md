# TODO

- Write unit tests!
- Implement a way to run stuff in parallel in JSON
- Show full stack traces on errors thrown by npm-launch itself only if a `verbose` flag is set
- Run JS code in sub process to prevent stdout/stderr to be written to unfiltered (breaks Listr output)
- Maybe: Allow methods to return an array of task names to execute
