# Task runner

Write scripts/makefiles by just exporting some JavaScript functions or JSON5.

(Usage: tasks.js)
(Usage: GIF: Run on CLI)

- Small, fast, supports JS code, JSON & JSON5
- Runs commands from local `node_modules/.bin` like npm scripts do
- Completely transparent API: Just write your methods or CLI command lines
- JS: async/await are available out-of-the-box
- JS: ES6 modules are available out-of-the-box
- Looks really nice on console
- Runs on node.js 4+

(No API. Just exporting functions: One function equals one task.)
