Minimalistic task runner on steroids. Write scripts using JSON5 or ES6 JavaScript modules.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Screencast" src="./doc/npm-launch.gif?raw=true" />
</p>

- Small, fast, supports JSON5 and JS code
- Clean and tidy: Show command's output only in case of error
- Fully compatible with package.json `scripts`: You can just copy & paste them to the launch file
- Runs locally installed commands from `node_modules/.bin` like package.json `scripts`
- Uses [Listr](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/listr) to provide beautiful console output
- Runs on node.js 4+


## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev npm-launch
```

## Why?

- Because `scripts` in package.json are a mess
- When they fail, `npm` prints ~25 lines of non-helpful disclaimers
- If a script called by another script fails, you already got 50 lines to scroll
- `gulp` & `grunt` instead need 100 lines of code for things that take less than five lines on the command line
- Your terminal is constantly flooded with output everytime you run a task

But no more! Let's take the sample launch file from the screencast before and use
it in our `package.json`:

  <img alt="Screencast" src="./doc/npm-launch-package.json.gif?raw=true" />
</p>

Here we go, everything is clean and concise now!

**A clean and short package.json. Commented tasks. Concurrency support out-of-the-box.**


## Usage (JSON)

```js
// File: launch.scripts.json5
{
  build: "webpack -c webpack-config.production.js",
  test:  "run-parallel lint mocha",

  //////////
  // Hooks:

  prepush: "run build && run test",

  //////////////////
  // Testing tasks:

  lint:  "standard lib/**/*.js",
  mocha: "mocha"
}
```

```sh
$ launch build test     # run tasks "build" and "test"
# or
$ launch -f path/to/launch-file build test
```

Features:
- Comments in JSON
- Run tasks concurrently by using `run-parallel <task1> <task2> ...` (or short `run-p`)
- Nicer syntax, easy to read and write
- Very short and concise
- Fully compatible with standard JSON


## Usage (ES6 module)

```js
// File: launch.scripts.js

const shell = module.parent.exports.shell
const delay = 1500

// Define a task "npmPruneList"
export async function npmPruneList () {
  // Execute `npm prune`
  await shell('npm prune')
  // Then execute `npm list`
  await shell('npm list')
}

// Define a task "wasteSomeTime"
export function wasteSomeTime () {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(), delay)
  })
}

// Define a task "default" that will just run "npmPruneList" & "wasteSomeTime" sequentially
export default [ npmPruneList, wasteSomeTime ]
```

Features:
- Completely transparent API: No need to import anything, just export
- ES6 module syntax is available out-of-the-box
- `async`/`await` are available out-of-the-box
- The additional power you need to solve complex tasks


## CLI

Run the tasks `build` and `test`:
```sh
launch build test
```

List all available tasks:
```sh
launch
```

Print CLI usage help text:
```sh
launch --help
```


## Tips

- If you do not provide a filename for a launch file it will look for a file named `launch.scripts.js`/`launch.scripts.json`/`launch.scripts.json5`
- Auto-camelcasing: Instead of `$ launch myTask` you can also run `$ launch my-task`


## Minor known limitations

These limitations only apply if your launch file contains custom JS code rather than JSON tasks.

#### No checkmark list for tasks being called by code

Tasks called by code are tracked and displayed, but not as a checkmark list,
but just as a hint which one is currently run. It's simple: In this case we
cannot create a list of subtasks beforehand, since there is no way to know
which sub-tasks the function is going to call.

#### console.log() in tasks may disturb the output

If you call `console.log()` (or similar) in your launch file then the checkmark
list will probably be corrupted.
