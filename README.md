# Task runner

- Small, fast, supports JS code, JSON & JSON5
- Runs commands from local `node_modules/.bin` like npm scripts do
- JS: async/await are available out-of-the-box
- JS: ES6 modules are available out-of-the-box
- Looks really nice

(No API. Just exporting functions: One function equals one task.)
